# Prettier plugin: Order Imports

This plugin automatically sorts your tsx imports in the ascending order of jsx component names. Single imports are given preference over multiple imports.

## How to use

Install the plugin as a dev dependency in your tsx project:

```zsh
npm i --save-dev git+https://github.com/gmnikhil/prettier-plugin-order-imports.git
```

Configure Prettier to use the plugin by adding it to your project's `.prettierrc` config file plugins option:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["prettier-plugin-order-imports"]
}
```

Close and reopen your editor to ensure that the configuration changes are captured.
